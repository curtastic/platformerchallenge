
Thank you for taking the time to apply for this Game Programmer position. The coding challenge we discussed is defined below. We are looking for understanding of the technology and framework, game logic, functionality, and behavior systems. Design will not be considered in the review so please don’t sweat the design details.
 
Your challenge is to create a 2D side-scroller game using the CreateJs library (EaselJS, TweenJS, SoundJS, PreloadJS) with the following requirements: 
A player character controlled with WASD and ‘Spacebar‘ to jump (other actions keymapped as desired) 
Create a rudimentary health and life system and display these in your UI
Create a game consumable (coins, stars, hearts etc) keep track of these somewhere in the UI
Create a method of attack (weapon, fireballs, fists, etc) and battle an NPC character
Create at least one NPC for the player character to interact with (FSM)
Create at least one NPC for the player character to battle against (FSM)
The latest version of the CreateJS library should be used 
JavaScript and CSS should be used with index.html as the entry point.
